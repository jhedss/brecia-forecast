# Inventory Forecast dashboard
 React + TensorFlow.js

What it is
- A React app that trains a simple TensorFlow.js model in the browser to predict whether a shoe SKU should be reordered.
- Product data is generated locally (150 shoe SKUs by default).

Quick start
1. Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start the app (normal)

```powershell
npm start
```

3. Developer demo (faster training)

This runs the dev server while setting a small epoch count (Windows):

```powershell
npm run dev-demo
```
